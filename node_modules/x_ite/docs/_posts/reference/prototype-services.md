## X3DProtoDeclaration

A PROTO declaration is represented by the X3DProtoDeclaration object. This object can only be fetched using the X3DExecutionContext object.

### Instance Creation Method\(s\)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Properties

#### **name**

A string of the declared name of this prototype. This property is read only.

#### **fields**

A reference to FieldDefinitionArray of all the fields defined for this prototype. This property is read only.

#### **isExternProto**

Always has the value of false. This property is read only.

### Methods

#### SFNode **newInstance** ()

Creates a new default instance of the prototype.

#### String **toVRMLString** (\[options\])

Returns the X3D VRML-encoded string that, if parsed as the value of createX3DFromString () of X3DBrowser, produce this prototype.

For options see X3DScene.toVRMLString.

#### String **toXMLString** (\[options\])

Returns the X3D XML-encoded string that, if parsed as the value of createX3DFromString () of X3DBrowser, produce this prototype.

For options see X3DScene.toVRMLString.

#### String **toJSONString** (\[options\])

Returns the X3D JSON-encoded string that, if parsed as the value of createX3DFromString () of X3DBrowser, produce this prototype.

For options see X3DScene.toVRMLString.

## X3DExternProtoDeclaration

An EXTERNPROTO declaration is represented by the X3DExternProtoDeclaration object. EXTERNPROTO declarations can only be fetched using the X3DExecutionContext object.

### Instance Creation Method\(s\)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Properties

#### **name**

A string of the declared name of this extern prototype. This property is read only.

#### **fields**

A reference to FieldDefinitionArray of all the fields defined for this extern prototype. This property is read only.

#### **urls**

A MFString array of all the URI's defined for this extern prototype. This property is read only.

#### **isExternProto**

Always has the value of true. This property is read only.

#### **loadState**

The value is one of the *_STATE* properties defined in the X3DConstants object. This property is read only.

### Methods

#### SFNode **newInstance** ()

Creates a new default instance of the extern prototype.

#### void **loadNow** ()

Triggers the load of the extern prototype. If the extern prototype is already loaded or the load is already in progress, this request is silently ignored.

#### String **toVRMLString** (\[options\])

Returns the X3D VRML-encoded string that, if parsed as the value of createX3DFromString () of X3DBrowser, produce this extern prototype.

For options see X3DScene.toVRMLString.

#### String **toXMLString** (\[options\])

Returns the X3D XML-encoded string that, if parsed as the value of createX3DFromString () of X3DBrowser, produce this extern prototype.

For options see X3DScene.toVRMLString.

#### String **toJSONString** (\[options\])

Returns the X3D JSON-encoded string that, if parsed as the value of createX3DFromString () of X3DBrowser, produce this extern prototype.

For options see X3DScene.toVRMLString.

## ProtoDeclarationArray

ProtoDeclarationArray is an object that represents an array of X3DProtoDeclaration objects. This is a read-only object. Individual elements of the array can be referenced using the standard C-style dereferencing operator (e.g. *protoDeclarationArrayName*[*index*], where *index* is an integer-valued expression with 0\<=*index*\<length and length is the number of elements in the array).

### Instance Creation Method\(s\)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Properties

#### **length**

An integer containing the number of elements in the array. This property is read only.

### Methods

None

## ExternProtoDeclarationArray

ExternProtoDeclarationArray is an object that represents an array of X3DExternProtoDeclaration objects. This is a read-only object. Individual elements of the array can be referenced using the standard C-style dereferencing operator (e.g. *externProtoDeclarationArrayName*[*index*], where *index* is an integer-valued expression with 0\<=*index*\<length and length is the number of elements in the array).

### Instance Creation Method\(s\)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Properties

#### **length**

An integer containing the number of elements in the array. This property is read only.

### Methods

None
